# Data Structures

Fundamental components in computer science that define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program.

## Types of Data Structures

There are 2 types of data structures:
1. Primitive data structures
2. Abstract data structures

### 1. Primitive Data Structures

Basic types of data structures that directly operate on machine instructions. They are fundamental to building more complex data structures and are provided as built-in types in a programming language.
- Examples: `int`, `str`, `float`, `bool`, etc.

### 2. Abstract Data Structures

More complex data structures that are built using primitive data structures. They provide a way to organize and store data in a manner that allows for efficient access and modification.
- Examples: `list`, `stacks`, `queues`, etc.

### Stacks

A collection that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

**Key operations:**
1. `push`: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. `pop`: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
3. `peek`: Return the top element without removing it.
4. `isEmpty`: Check if the stack is empty.

### Queue

A collection that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

**Key operations:**
1. `enqueue`: Add an element at the back of the queue.
2. `dequeue`: Remove and return the front element of the queue.
3. `front`: Return the front element without removing it.
4. `isEmpty`: Check if the queue is empty.
