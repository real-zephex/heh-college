# NumPy Module Notes

This document provides an overview of various functionalities of the NumPy library, a powerful tool for numerical computing in Python. Below are the key topics covered:

## 1. Array Creation
- **2D Array**: Creating a two-dimensional array.
- **Identity Matrix**: Creating an identity matrix.
- **Zero Matrix**: Creating a matrix filled with zeros.
- **Ones Matrix**: Creating a matrix filled with ones.
- **Random Matrix**: Creating a matrix with random elements.

## 2. Array Properties
- **Dimensions**: Printing the dimensions of an array.
- **Shape**: Printing the shape of an array.

## 3. Matrix Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition**: Adding two matrices.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracting one matrix from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplying two matrices.
- **Division**: Dividing one matrix by another.

## 4. Array Statistics
- **Sum**: Calculating the sum of elements in an array.
- **Square Root**: Calculating the square root of elements in an array.

## 5. Array Element Types
- **Data Type**: Printing the data type of elements in an array.
- **Type Conversion**: Converting array elements to different data types (e.g., string, integer, boolean).

## 6. Array Manipulation
- **Indexing and Slicing**: Accessing and modifying specific elements in an array.
- **Element Modification**: Changing the values of array elements.

## 7. Memory Management
- **Copy vs View**: Understanding the difference between copying arrays and viewing arrays.

## 8. Array Reshaping
- **Reshaping**: Changing the dimensions of an array while preserving its data.

## 9. Array Joining
- **Combining Arrays**: Merging multiple arrays into one.

Each section includes examples and explanations to illustrate the usage of NumPy functions and operations.
